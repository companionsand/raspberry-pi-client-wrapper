## Prerequisites

### Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 5 (recommended) or Pi 4
- USB microphone
- USB speaker or 3.5mm audio output
- MicroSD card (32GB+ recommended)
- Stable internet connection

### Software

- Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit) or Desktop
- Fresh system or clean install recommended

## Quick Start

### Option A: Automated Installation (No Prompts)

For a fully automated installation without any prompts:

1. **Create `.env` file** from the template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

2. **Fill in all values** in `.env`:

   ```bash
   # Required values
   DEVICE_ID=your-device-id
   ENV=production
   OTEL_CENTRAL_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT=https://your-collector.onrender.com:4318

   # Git configuration (optional)
   GIT_BRANCH=main  # Branch to use for raspberry-pi-client repo

   # Audio setup mode (optional)
   SKIP_ECHO_CANCEL_SETUP=false  # Set to true to skip PipeWire/echo cancellation
                                  # Use true if you have ReSpeaker with hardware AEC
                                  # Use false if using separate USB mic/speaker

   # Client configuration (all required for no-prompt install)
   SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-key
   EMAIL=your-email@example.com
   PASSWORD=your-password
   CONVERSATION_ORCHESTRATOR_URL=wss://your-backend.onrender.com/ws
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-key
   PICOVOICE_ACCESS_KEY=your-key

   # LED configuration (optional - for ReSpeaker)
   LED_ENABLED=true       # Enable LED visual feedback
   LED_BRIGHTNESS=60      # Brightness level (0-100)
   ```

3. **Run installation** - completely automated:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   # No prompts! Uses all values from .env
   ```

### Option B: Interactive Installation (With Prompts)

If you prefer to enter values during installation or don't have all values yet:

### 1. Copy Wrapper to Pi

Copy this entire `raspberry-pi-client-wrapper` directory to your Raspberry Pi:

```bash
# On your development machine:
scp -r raspberry-pi-client-wrapper pi@raspberrypi.local:~/

# Or use rsync:
rsync -av raspberry-pi-client-wrapper pi@raspberrypi.local:~/
```

### 2. Run Installation Script

SSH into your Raspberry Pi and run the installer:

```bash
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
cd ~/raspberry-pi-client-wrapper
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The installer will:

1. ✓ Check system compatibility
2. ✓ Install system dependencies (Python, ALSA, audio libraries)
3. ✓ Clone the raspberry-pi-client repository (now public!)
4. ✓ Create Python virtual environment
5. ✓ Install Python requirements
6. ✓ **Prompt for configuration** (Device ID, OTEL endpoint, Environment)
7. ✓ Setup OpenTelemetry Collector with systemd service
8. ✓ **Setup Echo Cancellation** (optional - prompts for microphone and speaker selection if not skipped)
9. ✓ Setup agent-launcher systemd service (with auto-restart)
10. ✓ Create .env template files

**Installation takes 5-10 minutes** depending on your Pi model and internet speed.

#### Automatic Verification and Rollback

After installation completes, `install.sh` automatically:

1. ✓ Starts all services (OTEL Collector, Agent Launcher)
2. ✓ Verifies services are running without errors
3. ✓ Checks echo cancellation devices are available
4. ✓ Analyzes service logs for errors

**If verification fails:**

- Services are automatically stopped
- Audio fix script runs to restore audio
- Error logs are displayed for debugging
- Installation exits with clear error messages

This ensures you never have a partially working system!

#### Installation Prompts

During installation, you'll be asked to provide:

- **Device ID**: Your unique device identifier
- **OTEL Central Collector Endpoint**: Your central telemetry collector URL (e.g., `https://your-collector.onrender.com:4318`)
- **Environment**: Deployment environment (production/staging/development)
- **Microphone Device**: Your USB microphone device name (from PulseAudio device list)
- **Speaker Device**: Your USB speaker device name (from PulseAudio device list)

These values will be automatically configured in the system and `.env` file.

### 3. Configure API Keys and Credentials

After installation, configure the client with your API keys:

```bash
nano ~/raspberry-pi-client-wrapper/raspberry-pi-client/.env
```

Fill in the required API keys and credentials:

```bash
# Already configured by installer:
DEVICE_ID=your-device-id        # ✓ Already set
ENV=production                  # ✓ Already set

# You need to fill in:
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key-here
EMAIL=your-email@example.com
PASSWORD=your-password-here
CONVERSATION_ORCHESTRATOR_URL=ws://your-backend:8001/ws
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-elevenlabs-api-key-here
PICOVOICE_ACCESS_KEY=your-picovoice-access-key-here
```

**Note:**

- If you used the automated installation (with .env file), all configuration is complete and services are already running!
- If you used interactive installation, Device ID, OTEL endpoint, and environment are already set. Add your API keys and restart services as shown below.

### 4. Restart Services (Interactive Mode Only)

**If you installed with .env file:** Services are already running, skip this step!

**If you installed interactively:** After adding API keys, restart services:

```bash
# Restart the agent launcher with new configuration
sudo systemctl restart agent-launcher

# Check status
sudo systemctl status otelcol
sudo systemctl status agent-launcher
```

### 5. View Logs

```bash
# Agent launcher logs (main application)
sudo journalctl -u agent-launcher -f

# OpenTelemetry Collector logs
sudo journalctl -u otelcol -f

# Combined view
sudo journalctl -u agent-launcher -u otelcol -f
```

## How It Works

### Auto-Restart on Crash

🔄 **The system is configured for maximum reliability:**

- If `main.py` crashes or errors out, systemd automatically restarts it
- No limit on restart attempts - it will keep trying indefinitely
- 10-second delay between restart attempts
- Restarts are logged in systemd journal

This ensures your device stays online even after:

- Python exceptions
- Network failures
- Temporary service disruptions
- System resource issues

### Boot Sequence

When the Raspberry Pi boots:

1. **Network Wait**: `agent-launcher.service` waits for network-online.target
2. **OTEL Start**: OpenTelemetry Collector starts (dependency)
3. **Launch Script**: `launch.sh` is executed by systemd

### Launch Script Flow

The `launch.sh` script runs on every boot:

```
1. Check Internet Connection
   ├─ Ping 8.8.8.8 with retries
   └─ Exit if no connection after 30 attempts

2. Update Code
   ├─ Clone repo if not exists
   └─ Git pull latest changes if exists

3. Setup Python Environment
   ├─ Create venv if not exists
   └─ Activate venv

4. Install Dependencies
   └─ pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Verify Configuration
   └─ Check .env file exists

6. Run Client
   └─ exec python main.py
```

### Services Overview

| Service                  | Type   | Purpose                   | Auto-Start | Auto-Restart      |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| `otelcol.service`        | System | OpenTelemetry Collector   | ✓ Yes      | ✓ Yes             |
| `agent-launcher.service` | System | Client Launcher & Updater | ✓ Yes      | ✓ Yes (unlimited) |

## Echo Cancellation (Optional)

### Overview

The wrapper supports two audio modes:

1. **PipeWire Echo Cancellation** (default - `SKIP_ECHO_CANCEL_SETUP=false`):
   - Software-based echo cancellation using PipeWire
   - Best for separate USB microphone and speaker
   - Enables "barge-in" (user can interrupt the AI)

2. **ALSA-Only Mode** (`SKIP_ECHO_CANCEL_SETUP=true`):
   - Direct ALSA access, no PipeWire
   - Best for ReSpeaker with hardware echo cancellation
   - Automatic device detection
   - Simpler, lighter setup

**To skip echo cancellation setup**, add to your wrapper `.env` file:
```bash
SKIP_ECHO_CANCEL_SETUP=true
```

### What is Echo Cancellation?

Echo cancellation (AEC) allows the device to:

- Play audio (AI speaking) through speakers
- Record audio (user speaking) through microphone
- Filter out the AI's voice from the microphone input
- Enable "barge-in" (user can interrupt the AI)

Without AEC, the microphone picks up the speaker's output, causing feedback loops.

**Note**: If you have ReSpeaker 4 Mic Array with built-in hardware AEC, you can skip PipeWire setup entirely by setting `SKIP_ECHO_CANCEL_SETUP=true`.

### Automatic Setup During Installation

**Echo cancellation is configured automatically during `install.sh`:**

#### Automated Mode (with .env file)

- Automatically detects default microphone and speaker
- Creates configuration without any prompts
- Falls back to interactive mode if auto-detection fails

#### Interactive Mode (without .env file)

1. The installer lists all available audio devices
2. Detects system defaults and asks for confirmation
3. If no defaults or user declines, prompts for device selection
4. Supports both device names and numbered selection
5. PipeWire configuration is created automatically
6. Virtual devices `echo_cancel.mic` and `echo_cancel.speaker` are created
7. `.env` file is automatically updated with these devices

**No additional setup required in either mode!**

### Manual Reconfiguration

If you need to change your audio devices later, run:

```bash
cd ~/raspberry-pi-client-wrapper/pipewire
./setup-echo-cancel.sh
```

This will:

- Re-list your audio devices
- Let you select different devices
- Update the configuration
- Restart services automatically

### Configuration Details

The script creates: `~/.config/pipewire/pipewire-pulse.conf.d/20-echo-cancel.conf`

This configuration:

- Uses WebRTC AEC algorithm (high quality)
- Creates virtual devices: `echo_cancel.mic` and `echo_cancel.speaker`
- Routes audio through echo cancellation filter
- Disables analog gain control for better quality

### Testing Echo Cancellation

```bash
# Start playing audio in one terminal
speaker-test -D echo_cancel.speaker -c2 -t wav

# Record in another terminal
arecord -D echo_cancel.mic -d 10 test.wav

# Play back the recording
aplay test.wav

# The recording should NOT contain the speaker-test audio
```

### Troubleshooting AEC

**Problem**: echo_cancel devices not created

```bash
# Check PipeWire logs
journalctl --user -u pipewire-pulse -n 50

# Verify config file exists
cat ~/.config/pipewire/pipewire-pulse.conf.d/20-echo-cancel.conf

# Restart services
systemctl --user restart wireplumber
systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse
```

**Problem**: Device names changed after reboot

USB device names can change. If this happens:

```bash
# List current devices
pactl list short sources
pactl list short sinks

# Re-run setup with new device names
cd ~/raspberry-pi-client-wrapper/pipewire
./setup-echo-cancel.sh
```

### Removing Echo Cancellation

```bash
# Remove configuration
rm ~/.config/pipewire/pipewire-pulse.conf.d/20-echo-cancel.conf

# Restart PipeWire
systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse

# Update .env to use original devices
nano ~/raspberry-pi-client-wrapper/raspberry-pi-client/.env
```

## Manual Operations

### Manually Update Code

```bash
cd ~/raspberry-pi-client-wrapper/raspberry-pi-client
git pull origin main
sudo systemctl restart agent-launcher
```

### Reinstall Dependencies

```bash
cd ~/raspberry-pi-client-wrapper/raspberry-pi-client
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall
```

### Reset to Fresh State

```bash
# Stop services
sudo systemctl stop agent-launcher
sudo systemctl stop otelcol

# Remove cloned repository
rm -rf ~/raspberry-pi-client-wrapper/raspberry-pi-client

# Restart (will re-clone)
sudo systemctl start agent-launcher
```

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Won't Start

**Check logs:**

```bash
sudo journalctl -u agent-launcher -n 50
```

**View restart history:**

```bash
# See how many times the service has restarted
sudo systemctl status agent-launcher

# Watch for restart events in real-time
sudo journalctl -u agent-launcher -f
```

**Common issues:**

- `.env` file not configured
- No internet connection
- Python dependencies failed to install
- Invalid credentials
- Repeated crashes (check Python error messages in logs)

**If the service is crash-looping:**
The service will keep restarting automatically. Check logs to identify the root cause:

```bash
# Get last 100 lines to see error pattern
sudo journalctl -u agent-launcher -n 100

# Filter for Python errors
sudo journalctl -u agent-launcher | grep -i error
```

### Audio Issues (No Microphone/Speaker Detected)

**Problem**: Audio devices not detected after installation

**Quick Fix**: Run the audio fix script:

```bash
cd ~/raspberry-pi-client-wrapper/pipewire
./fix-audio.sh
```

This script will:

- Remove problematic service configurations
- Reset failed PipeWire services
- Restart audio services properly
- List available audio devices

**Manual fix:**

```bash
# Reset failed services
systemctl --user reset-failed

# Restart PipeWire services
systemctl --user restart wireplumber
systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse

# Check audio devices
pactl list short sources  # microphones
pactl list short sinks    # speakers
```

**Test audio:**

```bash
# Test speaker
speaker-test -c2 -t wav

# Test microphone
arecord -d 5 test.wav && aplay test.wav
```

### OpenTelemetry Collector Issues

**Check status:**

```bash
sudo systemctl status otelcol
sudo journalctl -u otelcol -n 50
```

**Validate config:**

```bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/otelcol --config=/etc/otelcol/config.yaml validate
```

**Check connectivity:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-collector.onrender.com:4318/v1/traces
```

### Code Not Updating

**Force update:**

```bash
cd ~/raspberry-pi-client-wrapper/raspberry-pi-client
git fetch origin main
git reset --hard origin/main
sudo systemctl restart agent-launcher
```

### Service Won't Start on Boot

**Check service status:**

```bash
sudo systemctl is-enabled agent-launcher
sudo systemctl is-enabled otelcol
```

**Re-enable:**

```bash
sudo systemctl enable agent-launcher
sudo systemctl enable otelcol
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

## Development Mode

To run the client manually (not as a service):

```bash
# Stop the service
sudo systemctl stop agent-launcher

# Activate venv and run
cd ~/raspberry-pi-client-wrapper/raspberry-pi-client
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py

# When done, restart service
sudo systemctl start agent-launcher
```

## Uninstallation

### Quick Uninstall

To completely remove the wrapper and all services:

#### Interactive Mode (Default)

```bash
cd ~/raspberry-pi-client-wrapper
./uninstall.sh
```

#### Automated Mode (No Prompts)

```bash
cd ~/raspberry-pi-client-wrapper
./uninstall.sh --auto-yes
# or
./uninstall.sh -y
```

The uninstall script will:

1. Stop all services (agent-launcher, otelcol)
2. Disable all services
3. Remove service files from systemd
4. Remove OpenTelemetry Collector (binary, configs, data)
5. Remove cloned repository and virtual environment
6. **Prompt** to remove wrapper directory (optional)
7. **Prompt** to remove cached downloads (optional)
8. **Prompt** to remove system packages (optional)
9. **Prompt** to reboot (optional)

**Interactive Prompts (skipped with --auto-yes):**

- Remove entire wrapper directory? (defaults to no in auto mode)
- Remove cached downloads? (defaults to no in auto mode, speeds up reinstalls)
- Remove system packages? (defaults to no in auto mode, may be used by other apps)
- Reboot now? (defaults to no in auto mode)

### What Gets Removed

**Always removed:**

- ✓ All systemd services
- ✓ OpenTelemetry Collector
- ✓ Cloned raspberry-pi-client repository
- ✓ Python virtual environment

**Optional (prompted):**

- Wrapper directory with scripts
- System packages (pip, pipewire, etc.)

**Preserved:**

- System journal logs (can be manually cleared)
- PipeWire user configurations (may be used by other apps)

### Manual Uninstallation

If you prefer to uninstall manually:

```bash
# Stop and disable services
sudo systemctl stop agent-launcher
sudo systemctl disable agent-launcher
sudo systemctl stop otelcol
sudo systemctl disable otelcol
systemctl --user stop pipewire-aec
systemctl --user disable pipewire-aec

# Remove service files
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/agent-launcher.service
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/otelcol.service
rm ~/.config/systemd/user/pipewire-aec.service

# Remove OpenTelemetry Collector
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/otelcol
sudo rm -rf /etc/otelcol
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/otelcol
sudo rm -rf /var/log/otelcol

# Remove wrapper
rm -rf ~/raspberry-pi-client-wrapper

# Reload systemd
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl --user daemon-reload

# Reboot
sudo reboot
```

## Configuration Reference

### Git Repository

- **Branch**: Configurable via `GIT_BRANCH` in `.env` (default: `main`)
- **Clone Location**: `~/raspberry-pi-client-wrapper/raspberry-pi-client/`
- **Authentication**: None required (public repository)

### Paths

- **Wrapper**: `~/raspberry-pi-client-wrapper/`
- **Client**: `~/raspberry-pi-client-wrapper/raspberry-pi-client/`
- **Venv**: `~/raspberry-pi-client-wrapper/raspberry-pi-client/venv/`
- **Client .env**: `~/raspberry-pi-client-wrapper/raspberry-pi-client/.env`

### Service Files

- **Agent Launcher**: `/etc/systemd/system/agent-launcher.service`
- **OTEL Collector**: `/etc/systemd/system/otelcol.service`

## Performance Optimizations

### Cached Downloads

The installer caches downloaded files to speed up reinstallations:

**Location**: `~/raspberry-pi-client-wrapper/otel/.cache/`

**What's cached:**

- OpenTelemetry Collector tarball (~40MB)

**Benefits:**

- ✅ First installation: Downloads from internet
- ✅ Subsequent installations: Uses cached file (10x faster)
- ✅ Works offline after first download
- ✅ Preserves bandwidth

**Cache management:**

```bash
# Check cache size
du -sh ~/raspberry-pi-client-wrapper/otel/.cache

# Clear cache manually
rm -rf ~/raspberry-pi-client-wrapper/otel/.cache

# Uninstaller asks if you want to remove cache
# (Keeping it speeds up future reinstalls)
```
